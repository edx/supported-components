<p>The <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/text_input.html" target="[object Object]">text input problem type</a>&nbsp;is a core problem type that can be added to any course. At a minimum, text input problems include a question or prompt and a response field for free form answer text. By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.</p>
<p>In text input problems, learners enter text into a response field. The response can include numbers, letters, and special characters such as punctuation marks. Because the text that the learner enters must match the instructor&rsquo;s specified answer exactly, including spelling and punctuation, edX recommends that you specify more than one correct answer for text input problems to allow for differences in capitalization and typographical errors.</p>
