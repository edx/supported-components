<p>This course is designed to demonstrate all of the <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/create_exercises_and_tools.html" target="[object Object]">supported and provisional</a>&nbsp;features of the edX platform. When authoring a course in edX&nbsp;Studio, the support level for each exercise, problem type, or tool is represented with an icon when you select the Advanced, HTML, or Problem component buttons to add a new component to your course. By default, only fully supported or provisionally supported exercises, problem types, or tools are available for adding to your course.&nbsp;The purpose of this course is to include examples of each supported and provisional feature using standard and supported configurations. Unless otherwise noted, best practices for each feature are followed.</p>
<p>This course is useful&nbsp;for performing manual and automated testing, as well as for demonstrating the supported features of the edX platform and best practices for implementing them. Please contact <a href="mailto:msadecki@edx.org" target="[object Object]">the course author</a>&nbsp;to request improvements, enhancements, or to report errors and omissions.</p>
