<p>In multiple choice problems, learners select one option from a list of answer options. Unlike <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/dropdown.html#dropdown" target="[object Object]">dropdown problems</a>, where the answer choices do not appear until the learner selects the dropdown arrow, answer choices for multiple choice problems are immediately visible directly below the question.</p>
<p>Multiple choice problems can also have several advanced options, such as reordering, or shuffling, the set of answer choices for each learner. For more information about these options, see <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/multiple_choice.html#multiple-choice-advanced-options" target="[object Object]">Advanced Options for Multiple Choice Problems</a>.</p>
