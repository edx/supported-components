<p>The <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/numerical_input.html" target="[object Object]">numerical input problem type</a>&nbsp;is a core problem type that can be added to any course. At a minimum, numerical input problems include a question or prompt and a response field for a numeric answer. By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.</p>
<p>Responses for numerical input problems can include integers, fractions, and constants such as pi and g. Responses can also include text representing common functions, such as square root (sqrt) and log base 2 (log2), as well as trigonometric functions and their inverses, such as sine (sin) and arcsine (arcsin). For these functions, learners enter text that is converted into mathematical symbols. The following example shows a response entered by a learner and the numerical expression that results.</p>
