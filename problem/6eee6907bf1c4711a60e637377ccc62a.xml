<problem display_name="Protein Builder Example" markdown="null">
  <p>The protein builder allows you string together the building blocks of proteins, amino acids, and see how that string will form into a structure. You are presented with a goal protein shape, and your task is to try to re-create it. In the example below, the shape that you are asked to form is a simple line.</p>
  <p>Be sure to click "Fold" to fold your protein before you click "Check".</p>

    <p>
      Many protein sequences, such as the following example, fold to a straight line.You can play around with the protein builder if you're curious.
