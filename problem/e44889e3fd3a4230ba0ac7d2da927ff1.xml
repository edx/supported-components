  <p> Allopurinol is a drug used to treat and prevent gout, a very painful form of arthritis. Once only a “rich man’s disease”, gout has become more and more common in recent decades – affecting about 3 million people in the United States alone. Deposits of needle-like crystals of uric acid in connective tissue or joint spaces cause the symptoms of swelling, stiffness and intense pain. Individuals with gout overproduce uric acid because they cannot eliminate it efficiently. Allopurinol treats and prevents gout by stopping the overproduction of uric acid through inhibition of an enzyme required for the synthesis of uric acid. </p>
