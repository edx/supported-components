  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>This course is designed to demonstrate all of the supported and provisional features of the edX platform. When authoring a course in edX Studio, the support level for each exercise, problem type, or tool is represented with an icon when you select the Advanced, HTML, or Problem component buttons to add a new component to your course. By default, only fully supported or provisionally supported exercises, problem types, or tools are available for adding to your course. The purpose of this course is to include examples of each supported and provisional feature using standard and supported configurations. Unless otherwise noted, best practices for each feature are followed.</p>

  <p>This course is useful for performing manual and automated testing, as well as for demonstrating the supported features of the edX platform and best practices for implementing them. Please contact the <a href="mailto:msadecki@edx.org">course author</a> to request improvements, enhancements, or to report errors and omissions.</p>
